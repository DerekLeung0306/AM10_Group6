# Hotel Review Visualisation
## AM10_Group6

**Purpose & questions to answer:**
-	We will conduct a consulting service for a luxury hotel chain that wants to enter a European market: analysis of the European mid- & high-end hotel market
-	Cluster analysis based of reviewers / travellers
-	Sentiment analysis of reviews (Purpose of stay, Number of positive words, Number of negative words)
-	Analysis of density of hotels in regards to location and mapping of the best reviewed hotels

**Our Data visualisation ideas are among others as follows:**
Time series: the number of reviews throughout time to find out when do marketing

Mapping: the rating of hotels in different geography
